## Chatbot Agent for SQL Database Interaction

This repository contains the code for a chatbot agent that interacts with a SQL database containing sales data from a Superstore data set. The chatbot is capable of answering questions and generating SQL queries based on user inputs. The chatbot has two distinct versions (treatments) based on the provision of explanations:

1. Automatic Explanation Version: The chatbot automatically provides an explanation alongside its answer.
2. User-Invoked Explanation Version: The explanation is only displayed when the user voluntarily clicks a button to expand the explanation.


## Features

- The chatbot interacts with a PostgreSQL database that contains interaction data, which includes user queries and chatbot responses.
- Explanations for the chatbot's answers can either be provided automatically or via a button.
- The content of the explanations is the same in both versions; only the method of provision differs.
